# squinter
a small utility for comparing strings at the level of individual characters, made by a philologist, for philologists or anyone else 

squinter takes the strain out of comparing near-exact versions of text with long or otherwise difficult-to-read segments, by helping identify what actually needs attention and freeing you to ignore the rest
